# Data Engineering Exercise
Design and implement a data pipeline that pulls data from [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/api/?results=300&nat=de,dk,fr,gb&inc=id,gender,name,location,email,dob,picture,nat&seed=flightright). 

    https://randomuser.me/api/?results=300&nat=de,dk,fr,gb&inc=id,gender,name,location,email,dob,picture,nat&seed=flightright

 As an out put of this exercise we expect to see a minimum of the following:

1.  Python program that pulls data from the rest api
2.  CSV with all the data
3.  DDL to create a hypothetical database schema (you don't have to create a DB but you are welcome to)
4. Generate readable statistics from the data (plain text or any visualization tool or library) 
	- entries for each country
	- average age for each country
	- count genders for each country

The objective of this exercise is to have you walk us through a solution you have created. Do as much or as little as you would like.

## ReadMe

Please include:

-   a readme file that explains your thinking
-   a data model showing your design, explain why you designed the db and include the DDL used to generate the tables in your database
-   how to run and set up your project
-   if you have tests, include instructions on how to run them
-   a description of:
    -   enhancements you might make
    -   additional features you have added to help or that you found interesting
-   questions you have
-   recommendations for us

## Additional Info:

-   we expect that this will take you a few hours to complete
-   use any framework or library you are comfortable within Python
-   Bonus points for setting up a db
-   Bonus points for security, specs, etc.
-   Bonus points for deployment 
-   Do as little or as much as you like.

Ideally commit your code into a repo. Show your work and process through those commits. If you're not be able to commit your code, send us the files via email.
